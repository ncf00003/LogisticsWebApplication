# PrototypeWebApplication
### Project Overview
We plan to create a web app based on dynamic routes for logistics (shipping) companies. 
<p> This is our basic prototype with background research. We aim to make a visually appealing overview
of shipping times, routing, and tracking information. 
</p>

### Future Enhancements
(Work together to outline potential future
advancements to your application, including front-end and back-end
considerations.)


# Collective Research Findings

<strong> 1. Competitive Development </strong>
<br> https://www.fluentcargo.com/ is a similar website to what we plan on creating.</b>
<p> Fluent Cargo has a sleek design with multiple buttons that can direct user attention,
plus some ideas for what needs to be included on our web app. There is a search bar that I want to include plus
directional buttons for routes, tracking, schedules and ports. The website itself is full of eye catching and
moving visuals. At the bottom of the page, there is information about popular shipping routs which would be useful
to include for our app; although, I would place this on a seperate page for our project.</p>
<p> After inspecting the website to see its code Fluent Cargo appears to be using custom classes for each header or block of information.
Looking to sources, it appears that the site uses DatoCMS assets to assist in collaboration on the site and JS Stripe to accept secure payments. 
As for Bootstrap, the closest source file I could find was labeled globals.css. Under theme, there were only .ts files which may explain the 
moving graphics and videos throughout the site. </p>
<p> Overall, Fluent Cargo is a good source of functional inspiration but the design aspects are not. The design is very visually appealing
but it often takes a while to load on the user end which we would want to avoid. Plus, inspection of the site with browser tools revealed
that many sources and elements are beyond our scope for this project. With this project, advanced graphics and file types used to create this 
website are not as benefical for our efforts as the core functions of the site.
