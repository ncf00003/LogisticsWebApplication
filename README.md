# PrototypeWebApplication
### Project Overview
We plan to create a web app based on dynamic routes for logistics (shipping) companies. 
<p> This is our basic prototype with background research. We aim to make a visually appealing overview
of shipping times, routing, and tracking information. 
</p>

### Future Enhancements
<p> Crucially, this web applicaiton will need a creative name in the future. Outside of visual aspects which will improve as we work,
we need to continue improving functional aspects on our pages. 
</p>
<p> Front-end considerations are...</p>
<p> Back-end considerations are... </p>

# Collective Research Findings
## Natalia Furmanek 
<strong> 1. Competitive Development </strong>
<br> https://www.fluentcargo.com/ is a similar website to what we plan on creating.</b>
<p> Fluent Cargo has a sleek design with multiple buttons that can direct user attention, plus some ideas for what needs to be included on our web app. There is a search bar that I want to include plus directional buttons for routes, tracking, schedules and ports. The website itself is full of eye catching and moving visuals. At the bottom of the page, there is information about popular shipping routs which would be useful to include for our app; although, I would place this on a seperate page for our project.</p>
<p> After inspecting the website to see its code Fluent Cargo appears to be using custom classes for each header or block of information. Looking to sources, it appears that the site uses DatoCMS assets to assist in collaboration on the site and JS Stripe to accept secure payments. As for Bootstrap, the closest source file I could find was labeled globals.css. Under theme, there were only .ts files which may explain the moving graphics and videos throughout the site. </p>
<p> Overall, Fluent Cargo is a good source of functional inspiration but the design aspects are not. The design is very visually appealing but it often takes a while to load on the user end which we would want to avoid. Plus, inspection of the site with browser tools revealed that many sources and elements are beyond our scope for this project. With this project, advanced graphics and file types used to create this website are not as benefical for our efforts as the core functions of the site.
</p>

<strong> 2. GitHub Repository Research </strong>
<br> https://github.com/karrioapi/karrio is a Shipping web application repository that may be benefical to our project </b>
<br> Additionally, This project uses the Apache v2 license </b> 
<p> Karrio is a public open-source repository, comprised mainly of Python code but contains Javascript and CSS that we can better understand from class coverage.
The ReadMe file is visually appealing and outlines how to get started on the app alongside great detail of capabilities and shipping integration limitations. Some aspects of this repository that we may want to implement are: label generation, package tracking, and document generation. The website itself runs quickly and makes use of color blocks and minimal graphics.</p>
<p> Finally, Karrio clearly defines user and admin capabilities which could be an interesting aspect to borrow in our logistics web application. Karrio specifies that this is a developer resource, so it is appropriate for our project efforts. Although, in using this code, we need to keep in mind the limitations and use of Python which we have not covered in class yet.

<strong> 3. Prototype Development </strong>
<br> Created and shared repository alongside initial ReadMe format </b> 
<p> Added Minty Bootswatch theme into project design </p>
<p> Git Changes trouble shooting to fix push and branch errors </p>
<p> Added "Welcome" page that was named "Start Here" on the navigation bar. Also added visuals with alt. text to both pages for cohesion of pages. "Start Here" will include overview and about information which may change as we narrow down ideas for our websites function and a table for team information. Created a CSS "box" as a style option used for blocking paragraphs together on my page. Team table created with name, role and class information about group members. Table was formatted using bootstrap and custom style to blend in with CSS box and add unity. Added Javascript element to hide the team table and to make the table re-appear on the Welcome page.

<br>Samsara is a fleet management system that provides estimated route times for logistics companies.</b> 
<p>The software uses weather data (from the weather channel) to calculate delivery times and enables real-time trailer tracking. It also integrates data from environmental monitoring hardware to update estimated times and distances during transit. However, the software apparently doesn't use historical data to refine estimations or offer a dynamic quoting system for logistics companies to enhance productivity and improve quotes. The site offers Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions and seems to be built with Vue.js for the front-end. Buttons and other elements use Bootstrap naming conventions, and I found 22 CSS files with custom Bootstrap styling.</p>

<strong> 2. GitHub Repository Research </strong>
<br>[Fleetbase](https://github.com/fleetbase/fleetbase?tab=readme-ov-file#-features) is an open-source modular logistics and supply chain operating system (LSOS).</b> 
<p>Being open-source gives us the advantage of accessing specific scripts and having a good base of what the market currently uses. It also has a driver app, ensuring we address not only our primary customer (the logistics company) but also the drivers. As a finalized, customer-facing product, it's frequently updated by the community and includes the latest industry features. It's developed in containers, which is a plus as we can see how these business applications work and operate, offering infinite scalability. It also has dashboard creation functionality for visibility into operations. I think it's an all-encompassing GitHub repository we can refer to when we need direction, scope, or more features for the web application.</p>


<strong> 3. Prototype Development </strong>
<br>I developed the Privacy Policy page.</b>
<p>Although it's automatically added to the navigation by the .NET application, I believe it's crucial for any business. In creating this page, I used h2 and h3 headings. I should disclose that I used ChatGPT to generate sample text for the policy at this stage. When the web app goes to market, we'll update it to ensure customers understand what data and information we collect. I added IDs to the headings for later reference in the table of contents. For the table of contents, I created a table with headers and added links to different sections of the privacy policy in the rows. I used a divider with a class to add custom CSS to the table of contents. As mentioned in Tuesday's class, ChatGPT is really good with CSS!</p>
<strong> 4. Resources </strong>
<br>ChatGPT</b>
<p>Prompt 1: Make a sample privacy policy for a Web Application that makes dynamic quotes for logistic companies based on weather data from the locations in the route.</p
<p>Prompt 2: How can I style nicely the table of contents for this privacy policy using HTML and CSS?</p>
