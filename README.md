# PrototypeWebApplication
### Project Overview
We plan to create a web app based on dynamic routes for logistics (shipping) companies. 
<p> This is our basic prototype with background research. We aim to make a visually appealing overview
of shipping times, routing, and tracking information. 
</p>

### Future Enhancements
(Work together to outline potential future
advancements to your application, including front-end and back-end
considerations.)

<br> https://www.fluentcargo.com/ is a similar website to what we plan on creating.</b>
<p> Fluent Cargo has a sleek design with multiple buttons that can direct user attention,
plus some ideas for what needs to be included on our web app. There is a search bar that I want to include plus
directional buttons for routes, tracking, schedules and ports. The website itself is full of eye catching and
moving visuals. At the bottom of the page, there is information about popular shipping routs which would be useful
to include for our app; although, I would place this on a seperate page for our project.</p>
