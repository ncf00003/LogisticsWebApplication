<br> https://www.fluentcargo.com/ is a similar website to
what we plan on creating. Fluent Cargo has a sleek design with multiple buttons that can direct user attention,
plus some ideas for what needs to be included on our web app. There is a search bar that I want to include plus
directional buttons for routes, tracking, schedules and ports.
