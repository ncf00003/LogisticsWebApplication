   <br> https://www.fluentcargo.com/ is a similar website to what we plan on creating.</b>
   <br> Fluent Cargo has a sleek design with multiple buttons that can direct user attention,
   plus some ideas for what needs to be included on our web app. There is a search bar that I want to include plus
   directional buttons for routes, tracking, schedules and ports. The website itself is full of eye catching and
   moving visuals. At the bottom of the page, there is information about popular shipping routs which would be useful
   to include for our app; although, I would place this on a seperate page for our project. </b>
