## Homework 4 â€“ Due October 31

### Group Assignment
Design a web application with your group. Outline the user experience in words, detailing the features and functionality. Your application must include:

- **Eight Pages**: 
  - At least four pages must be dynamic, integrating APIs you've created.
  - Provide a brief description of all eight pages, explaining the user interactions available on each.
  - You may use images and diagrams for clarification.

- **APIs**:
  - Create at least eight APIs based on stored procedures.
  - Incorporate an external API for climate or weather information.
  - Emphasize user-generated content to drive content creation and engagement.

- **ASP.NET Web APIs**: 
  - Develop classes for implementing the Stored Procedures from Homework 3 (or reasonable substitutes).

Submit your web application proposal/ design in a markdown document linked from the main README.

### Individual Assignment
- **API Development**:
  - Independently, each group member should create two APIs based on stored procedures, using those from Homework 3 or new ones.
  - These APIs will be part of the final web application.
  - Document your APIs in a README markdown file within your Web API solution folder, detailing purpose, inputs, and outputs.
