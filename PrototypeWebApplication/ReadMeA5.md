><strong> Application Integration:</strong>
><br> Make sure website is uniformly structured and uses all applicable APIs from Assignment 4: 
><p> Structure is re-used from Assignment 2 so all pages have the same format. There should eventually be integration buttons so the Home Page has navigation to all user actions, since there are 6 Razor Pages and >multiple functions within many, it makes more sense to link these on the home page over the nav bar. </p>
><p>Made sure all CRUD opperations work plus figured out binary[] exception issue.</p>
