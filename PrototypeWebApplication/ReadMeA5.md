# Assignment Group Assignment
<strong> Application Integration:</strong>
<p> Make sure website is uniformly structured and uses all applicable APIs from Assignment 4</p>
Structure is re-used from Assignment 2 so all pages have the same format. There should eventually be integration buttons so the Home Page has navigation to all user actions, since there are 6 Razor Pages and multiple functions within many, it makes more sense to link these on the home page over the nav bar.
