<p>
    Parcel shipping is the process of sending packages from one location to another, often across cities, states, or even countries. If you're new to shipping, here are the basics you need to know about how it works:
</p>

<br/>
<h2 id="ShippingTimes">Shipping Times</h2>

<p>
    Shipping times depend on factors like distance, service level, and the carrier you choose. Most carriers offer different service options:
</p>

<h3>- Standard Shipping</h3>
<p>Typically the most affordable, but it can take several days depending on the destination.</p>

<h3>- Expedited Shipping</h3>
<p>Costs more, but delivers faster—usually within 1 to 3 days.</p>

<h3>- Same-Day or Next-Day Shipping</h3>
<p>For urgent deliveries, this option ensures your package arrives within a day but comes with a higher price tag.</p>

<br/>
<h2 id="RoutingInformation">Routing Information</h2>

<p>
    Once your parcel is shipped, it goes through a process called routing. Here's what happens:
</p>

<h3>- Pickup</h3>
<p>The carrier collects the package either from your location or a drop-off point.</p>

<h3>- Sorting</h3>
<p>At a local facility, the package is sorted and sent to its next stop.</p>

<h3>- Tranist</h3>
<p>The package may pass through several regional hubs where it gets sorted again until it reaches a facility close to the final destination.</p>

<h3>- Final Delivery</h3>
<p>Once it reaches a local delivery center, it's loaded onto a vehicle for the final leg of the journey to your doorstep.</p>

<br/>
<h2 id="TrackingInformation">Tracking Information</h2>

<p>
    Most carriers offer real-time tracking to give you updates about your parcel's location and status. Here’s how it works:
</p>

<h3>Tracking Number</h3>
<p>Every shipment gets a unique number. You can use this to check where your parcel is along its journey.</p>

<h3>Status Updates</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Picked Up:</strong> Your parcel is in the carrier’s hands.</li>
    <li><strong>In Transit:</strong> The package is on its way to the destination.</li>
    <li><strong>Out For Delivery:</strong> It’s on the delivery vehicle and should arrive soon.</li>
    <li><strong>Delivered:</strong> The parcel has reached its final destination.</li>
</ul>
