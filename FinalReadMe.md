# Deployment Guide
To begin implementation, first pull the most recent version of our SQL Database folder. 
1. Start with [DatabaseCreation.sql](https://github.com/ncf00003/LogisticsWebApplication/blob/main/SQL/DatabaseData.sql). Execute Query as is.
   <br> After, move on the entering the data in DatabaseData.sql
2. Then execute UserEncryptDatabaseUpdate.sql, Vehicles API Integration NF.sql, and the Shipments Update Assignment 4 NF.sql files
   <br> These allow the database to connect with web api's appropriately.
3. Proceed to all Stored Procedure files, marked with SPs 
4. Pull the "PrototypeWebApplication" folder: This is the original Project File that we will build off of when moving to the next files. Implement this project folder in visual studio. 
5. Proceed to add a new project for the API pages: Project Files are stored in the "LogisticsWebAppAPI" Folder
